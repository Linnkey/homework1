    This is an official web-page of motorcycle enthusiasts from Latvia. We travel around the world on Honda ST Pan European. 
</h2>

<p> For now we have visited already more than 15 countries and filmed 9 blogs about travelling by motorcycle. 
    During the Covid-19 pandemic we had a chance to travel a lot inside our home country Latvia, so we have made some great videos on local sights and unknown "pearls". 
    On the top of the page you can see one of our latest videos, filmed in Latvia.
<p> <b> Why are we travelling by motorcycle? </b> <br> 
    There are many reasons, here we will mention just some of them:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You feel really close to nature</li>
    <li>It is a great way to take some rest from gadgets and spend some time on your own while driving</li>
    <li>It is a good opportunity to meet great people around the world</li>
  </ul>  
<p> <b> What are the main risks and/or challenges? </b> </p>
<ol>
    <li>Weather. If the weather is too hot or too rainy, travelling by motorcycle becomes more complicated. </li>
    <li>Quality of the road. If the road is really bad, then travelling by motorcycle can become really dangerous.  </li>
    <li>Equipment. A driver and his passenger should have specific equipment, which ensures safety and protects from unpredictable weather conditions. Good equipment may cost a lot.</li>
  </ol>
